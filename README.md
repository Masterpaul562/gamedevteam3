# Overview of Game #1
Card game. Player life-based. Players play against each other to win by decreasing the opponent's health to 0. Fantasy cards with creatures and monsters. Pixaleted. Cards have abilities that activate with different criteria. Creature cards also have attack power and health. Creatures have to attack the player to do damage. Like magic the gathering.
# Overview of Game #2
Rogue like. You control a single character that is in the center of the screen and the game sends the hordes to kill you. You start with an ability to kill the enemies and killing the enemies gives you the experience to level up and get more abilities. All abilities can be leveled up instead of getting a new one to kill more enemies. The longer it goes on the harder the enemies become. The score in the game is to see how far you can survive. Like Vampire Survivor.

## Core Gameplay Mechanics
Combat against hordes of enemies with automatic and manual abilities
Control of character movement with WASD
We will give them a lot of visual feedback like the monsters that will each be different. There will also be an audio part when you take damage heal or do other special abilities.
## Story and Settings
You are trying to escape the dungeon.
Medieval setting in a dungeon with big rooms.
The player will be in a dungeon.
## Art and Sound
It will be in pixel art.
We will create pixel art for both the characters and different enemies. There will be different kinds/classes for enemies, and the variations will look different.
We will use background music that fits the theme of the game and will also enhance the gameplay for the player. There will also be graphics for the game that fit the music that plays in the background. We will have different sound effects for each of the upgrades as well as sound effects for the enemies.

## Diffuclty and Progression
There will likely be a timer and during certain points in time, the game will summon stronger enemies depending on how long you have been playing
Continuous play experience, but the player and the enemies slowly increase in “level” or difficulty.
## User Interface and User Experience
key binds and mouse.
yes, it is easy to understand.
## Technical Requirements
Coded in processing.
We will have to create collision detection and it will also be difficult to create a way for the person to stay in the center of the screen while still creating a larger arena they can move around in. It will also be a challenge to make the monsters always come directly towards you.
