# Overview of Game #1
Card game. Player life-based. Players play against each other to win by decreasing the opponent's health to 0. Fantasy cards with creatures and monsters. Pixaleted. Cards have abilities that activate with different criteria. Creature cards also have attack power and health. Creatures have to attack the player to do damage. Like magic the gathering.
# Overview of Game #2
Rogue like. You control a single character that is in the center of the screen and the game sends the hordes to kill you. You start with an ability to kill the enemies and killing the enemies gives you the experience to level up and get more abilities. All abilities can be leveled up instead of getting a new one to kill more enemies. The longer it goes on the harder the enemies become. The score in the game is to see how far you can survive. Like vampire survivor.
